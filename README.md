# üèéÔ∏è F1 Pit Stop Strategy Simulator
[**Launch Simulator**](https://pit-stop-sim.streamlit.app/)

An advanced, interactive Formula 1 pit stop strategy simulator that uses **Reinforcement Learning** and **Machine Learning** to optimize race strategies.  
This project demonstrates how AI agents can learn optimal pit stop timing and tire compound selection through dynamic race simulations.

---

## üéØ What This Project Does
This simulator creates a realistic F1 race environment where AI agents learn to make strategic pit stop decisions by considering:

- **Dynamic tire degradation** with realistic wear patterns for different compounds (Soft, Medium, Hard, Intermediate, Wet)  
- **Weather conditions** including probabilistic rain forecasts and intensity changes  
- **Track incidents** like Safety Cars and Virtual Safety Cars that create strategic opportunities  
- **Traffic effects** and fuel consumption that impact lap times  
- **Team characteristics** and driver profiles that influence decision-making  
- **FIA regulations** including mandatory tire compound usage in dry races

## üß† Core Innovation
The project combines **Q-Learning** and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** agents that learn optimal strategies through thousands of simulated races, then provides interactive tools to analyze and compare their performance against custom strategies.

- Git  
- ~2GB disk space for models and data  

### Quick Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/rembertdesigns/pit-stop-simulator.git
cd pit-stop-simulator
```
2. **Create Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
```
python3 -m venv venv

### Training Your Models  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You must train the models yourself ‚Äî they are not provided.

1. **Generate Initial Data**
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Navigate to the app and run 2-3 race simulations to generate initial data in `logs/gym_race_lap_data.csv`.

2. **Train Lap Time Predictor**
```
python train_lap_model.py
```
This creates `models/lap_time_predictor.pkl` for ML insights.

3. **Train Q-Learning Agents**
```
python main.py
```
This trains agents for all team/profile combinations and saves them to `saved_agents/`.

4. **Train PPO Agent**
```
python train_ppo.py
```
This creates `models/ppo_pit_stop.zip` for advanced RL strategies.

### Launch the Simulator
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Open your browser to http://localhost:8501 and start simulating!
