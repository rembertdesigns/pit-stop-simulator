## üéØ Overview

This simulator creates a high-fidelity F1 race environment where AI agents learn optimal pit stop strategies through reinforcement learning. The system models complex race dynamics including:

- **Race Dynamics Simulation**
  - **Tire Degradation Models:** Non-linear wear patterns with compound-specific coefficients  
    - Soft: High grip, rapid degradation (1.5x base rate)
    - Medium: Balanced performance (1.0x base rate)
    - Hard: Durability focus (0.7x base rate)
    - Intermediate/Wet: Weather-dependent characteristics

- **Environmental Factors**
  - Dynamic weather system with probabilistic rain forecasts
  - Track temperature variations (20-50¬∞C range)
  - Grip factor evolution based on rubber buildup and conditions

- **Race Incidents**
  - Safety Car (SC) deployments with configurable duration
  - Virtual Safety Car (VSC) periods
  - Strategic opportunity windows during caution periods

- **Performance Variables**
  - Traffic modeling with time penalties (1-10s per lap)
  - Fuel consumption effects on lap times (~0.03s per kg)
  - FIA regulation compliance (mandatory compound usage)

## üß† Core Innovation

### Dual-Agent Architecture

The project implements two complementary reinforcement learning approaches:

1. **Q-Learning Agent**
   - **Algorithm:** Tabular Q-Learning with discretized state space
   - **State Space Discretization:**
```python
State = (
    lap_bucket,           # 0-3 (race phase)
    tire_wear_bucket,     # 0-9 (0-100% in 10% increments)
    traffic_bucket,       # 0-2 (low/medium/high)
    rain_status,          # 0-1 (binary)
    safety_car_status,    # 0-1 (binary)
    vsc_status           # 0-1 (binary)
)
```
**Action Space:** 6 discrete actions

- **Action 0:** Stay out (no pit)
- **Actions 1-5:** Pit for specific compound (Soft / Medium / Hard / Intermediate / Wet)

**Learning Parameters:**

- **Learning rate (Œ±):** 0.1
- **Discount factor (Œ≥):** 0.99
- **Epsilon-greedy exploration:** Œµ = 1.0 ‚Üí 0.01 (decay over 2000 episodes)

2. **PPO Agent (Proximal Policy Optimization)**
  - Framework: Stable-Baselines3 implementation
  - Observation Space: 7-dimensional continuous vector
```python
obs = [
    current_lap / total_laps,        # Normalized race progress
    tire_wear / 100.0,               # Normalized tire condition
    traffic,                         # Traffic intensity [0, 1]
    fuel_weight / initial_fuel,      # Normalized fuel load
    rain_intensity,                  # Rain strength [0, 1]
    safety_car_active,               # Binary flag
    vsc_active                       # Binary flag
]
```
