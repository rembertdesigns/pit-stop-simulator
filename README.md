### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
Pre-trained models are **not included** in the repository. You must train them yourself using the provided scripts.

### Training Workflow - 4-Step ML Pipeline
```bash
1. Generate Data ‚Üí 2. Train ML Predictor ‚Üí 3. Train Q-Agents ‚Üí 4. Train PPO Agent
```
#### Step 1: Generate Initial Data

Run 2-3 race simulations to create training data:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
**Action Items**:
- Navigate to the app (http://localhost:8501)
- Configure race settings (50+ laps recommended)
- Run simulations with varied conditions (rain, SC, different tracks)
- Verify `logs/gym_race_lap_data.csv` contains data (should have 100+ rows)

#### Step 2: Train Lap Time Predictor
```bash
python train_lap_model.py
```
**What This Does**:
- Loads data from `logs/gym_race_lap_data.csv`
- Preprocesses features (one-hot encoding, normalization)
- Trains RandomForestRegressor
- Saves model to `models/lap_time_predictor.pkl`
- Prints evaluation metrics (RMSE, R¬≤, feature importances)

**Expected Output**:
```bash
Training set size: 800 samples, Test set size: 200 samples
Training RandomForestRegressor model with 14 features...
Model training complete.

--- Model Evaluation on Test Set ---

- **Overtaking:** +0.1s penalty (cautious approach)
- **Best For:** One-stop strategies, high-degradation tracks, overcut tactics

### Weather System - Dynamic Race Conditions

#### Rain Forecast Configuration

Define probabilistic weather windows for realistic race scenarios:
```python
rain_forecast_ranges = [
    {
        "start": 15,           # Rain window start lap
        "end": 25,             # Rain window end lap
        "probability": 0.7,    # 70% chance of precipitation
        "intensity": 0.6       # Rain strength: 0.0 (light) to 1.0 (heavy)
    }
]
```
#### Multiple Weather Windows Example:
```python
rain_forecast_ranges = [
    {"start": 10, "end": 20, "probability": 0.5, "intensity": 0.3},  # Light rain
    {"start": 35, "end": 50, "probability": 0.8, "intensity": 0.8}   # Heavy rain
]
```
#### Rain Effects on Race Performance

**Lap Time Penalties:**
- **Light rain (0.1-0.3):** +5-8 seconds per lap
- **Medium rain (0.4-0.6):** +8-12 seconds per lap
- **Heavy rain (0.7-1.0):** +12-15 seconds per lap

**Grip Reduction:**
- **Dry conditions:** 100% grip (baseline)
- **Light rain:** 70-80% grip (-20-30% reduction)
- **Heavy rain:** 40-60% grip (-40-60% reduction)

**Tire Compound Requirements:**
- **Intensity < 0.4:** Intermediate tires recommended
- **Intensity ‚â• 0.4:** Full wet tires mandatory
- **FIA Rule:** Must use at least one wet/intermediate compound in wet races

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Early pit advantage:** Teams can switch to wet tires before rain intensity increases
- **Track position gamble:** Stay out on slicks or pit early for inters
- **Safety Car potential:** Heavy rain often triggers Safety Car deployments

## üìä Performance Metrics
<img 
  width="1584" 
  height="396" 
  alt="Performance Metrics - AI Agent Evaluation for F1 Pit Stop Strategy with Total Reward, Pit Efficiency, and Machine Learning Accuracy Benchmarks" 
  title="F1 Simulator Performance Analysis - Q-Learning vs PPO Agent Metrics and ML Model Accuracy"
  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa7fe944-f678-48a9-b21d-4ef37ca913b0"
  loading="lazy"
/>

### Agent Evaluation Metrics - Measuring AI Performance

#### Total Reward - Cumulative Race Score

The primary metric for evaluating reinforcement learning agent performance:
```bash
Total Reward = Œ£(lap_rewards) - penalties
where lap_reward = -(lap_time) + bonuses
```
**Formula Breakdown:**
- **Lap Reward:** Negative lap time (faster = better reward)
- **Bonuses:** Overtake bonuses, strategic timing rewards
- **Penalties:** FIA regulation violations, unsafe maneuvers
- **Objective:** Maximize total reward (minimize race time)

**Interpretation:**
- Higher reward = Better strategy (closer to 0)
- Lower reward = Slower race time
- Typical range: -6000 to -4700 units

#### Pit Efficiency Rating - Strategy Optimization Score

Measures how effectively pit stops are executed relative to total race time:
```bash
Pit Efficiency = 100 √ó (1 - (pit_stops √ó pit_time) / total_race_time)
```
**Formula Components:**

- **pit_stops:** Number of pit stops executed
- **pit_time:** Time lost per pit stop (~20-35s)
- **total_race_time:** Complete race duration
- **Result:** Percentage efficiency (0-100%)

**Example Calculation:**
```bash
2 pit stops √ó 28s = 56s lost
Total race time: 5400s (90 min race)
Pit Efficiency = 100 √ó (1 - 56/5400) = 98.96%
```
**Performance Targets:**
- **Excellent:** >95% (minimal pit time impact)
- **Good:** 90-95% (balanced strategy)
- **Poor:** <85% (excessive pit stops)

#### FIA Penalties - Regulation Compliance

Penalties applied for violating Formula 1 technical regulations:

**Current Penalties:**
- **Missing 2-compound rule:** -20 reward units
  - Applies to dry races only
  - Must use at least 2 different tire compounds
  - Ensures strategic variety

**Future Penalties (Roadmap):**
- **Unsafe pit release:** -10 units (v2.0 feature)
- **Speeding in pit lane:** -5 units (planned)
- **Track limits violations:** -3 units per incident (planned)

### Typical Performance Ranges - Agent Comparison

Benchmarks from 100+ race simulations across varied conditions:

| Metric | Q-Learning | PPO | Custom Strategy |
|--------|------------|-----|-----------------|
| **Total Reward** | -5500 to -4800 | -5300 to -4700 | -6000 to -5000 |
| **Avg Pit Stops** | 1-3 | 1-2 | User-defined |
| **Pit Efficiency** | 85-92% | 88-95% | 70-95% |
| **Win Rate** | 35-40% | 45-55% | 10-30% |
| **Strategy Consistency** | Medium | High | Variable |

#### Performance Analysis

**Q-Learning Agent:**
- **Strengths:** Fast inference, interpretable decisions
- **Weaknesses:** Limited generalization to novel scenarios
- **Best Use Cases:** Well-defined tracks, stable conditions

**PPO Agent:**
- **Strengths:** Superior performance, excellent adaptability
- **Weaknesses:** Slower training (2-3 hours)
- **Best Use Cases:** Complex weather, mixed conditions, competitive racing

**Custom Strategy:**
- **Strengths:** Full user control, educational value
- **Weaknesses:** Requires F1 knowledge, inconsistent results
- **Best Use Cases:** Testing specific strategies, learning pit timing

### ML Model Accuracy - Lap Time Predictor Performance

RandomForest regressor metrics for lap time prediction:

#### Model Performance Benchmarks

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**
- **Range:** 1.5-2.5 seconds
- **Interpretation:** Average prediction error
- **Target:** <2.0s for production use
- **Typical:** 1.8s on test set

**R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination):**
- **Range:** 0.85-0.92
- **Interpretation:** Variance explained by model
- **Target:** >0.85 for reliable predictions
- **Typical:** 0.89 on test set

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
- **Typical:** 1.2-1.8 seconds
- **Best Case:** <1.5s with abundant training data

#### Feature Importance Rankings

Top predictors of lap time performance (from trained model):

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Impact |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **tire_wear** | 35% | Most critical - exponential lap time increase |
| 2 | **lap_number** | 18% | Fuel load reduction improves pace |
| 3 | **fuel_weight** | 14% | ~0.03s per kg impact |
| 4 | **traffic** | 12% | Overtaking difficulty affects lap time |
| 5 | **tire_compound** | 10% | Soft vs. Hard performance differential |
| 6 | **track_temp** | 6% | Grip variation with temperature |
| 7 | **rain_intensity** | 5% | Wet conditions slow pace |

**Key Insights:**
- Tire wear is 2√ó more important than any other feature
- Combined tire metrics (wear + compound) = 45% importance
- Weather factors (rain, temp) = 11% importance
