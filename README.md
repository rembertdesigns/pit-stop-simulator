## üéØ Overview

This simulator creates a high-fidelity F1 race environment where AI agents learn optimal pit stop strategies through reinforcement learning. The system models complex race dynamics including:

- **Race Dynamics Simulation**
  - **Tire Degradation Models:** Non-linear wear patterns with compound-specific coefficients  
    - Soft: High grip, rapid degradation (1.5x base rate)
    - Medium: Balanced performance (1.0x base rate)
    - Hard: Durability focus (0.7x base rate)
    - Intermediate/Wet: Weather-dependent characteristics

- **Environmental Factors**
  - Dynamic weather system with probabilistic rain forecasts
  - Track temperature variations (20-50¬∞C range)
  - Grip factor evolution based on rubber buildup and conditions

- **Race Incidents**
  - Safety Car (SC) deployments with configurable duration
  - Virtual Safety Car (VSC) periods
  - Strategic opportunity windows during caution periods

- **Performance Variables**
  - Traffic modeling with time penalties (1-10s per lap)
  - Fuel consumption effects on lap times (~0.03s per kg)
  - FIA regulation compliance (mandatory compound usage)
